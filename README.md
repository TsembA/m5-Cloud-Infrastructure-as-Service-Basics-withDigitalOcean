5 - Cloud & Infrastructure as Service Basics with DigitalOcean
DigitalOcean is a cloud provider that falls under the category of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). It enables users to deploy virtual machines, databases, load balancers, and other cloud resources with ease.

One of DigitalOceanâ€™s key advantages is its developer-friendly services. For instance, you can quickly spin up a droplet (virtual machine) with a pre-installed Docker image, allowing you to run containers seamlessly within a virtualized environment.

The setup process is straightforward: you choose an image, configure the virtual machine size, and optionally add an SSH key for secure and easy access.

This is particularly useful for running applications like Nexus directly on the machine or hosting a service within a Docker container on a virtual machine, such as a Jenkins setup.
